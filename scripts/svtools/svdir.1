This utility tries to find the daemontools service directory and
print it to stdout. It first checks the current directory of a
running svscan process and then it checks some default locations
like \fI\,/var/lib/svscan\/\fP and \fI\,/service\/\fP. It returns 0 if it have found
the location and 1 if not.
