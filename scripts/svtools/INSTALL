Install instructions:

1. Edit the Makefile and change the default install locations if you like.

2. Type 'make' to create the man pages

3. Type 'make install' to install the scripts and man pages.


You should then create the base service directory (Default: /etc/sv) and the
base log directory (Default: /var/log/sv) and give them root as owner.
Otherwise these directories are automatically created by your first service
creation and they are then owned by the first created service/log user which
is probably not what you want.
